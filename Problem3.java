/*
* Problem 3[20 pts]
* Write a program that finds the transpose of a matrix,
* read from a text file (Problem3.txt)
* The first line in the file will be the dimensions.
* The rest of lines will be the matrix
*
* Input:
* No parameter needed in your method, but there is a txt file 
* you need to download and use for this problem.

* txt file context example:
*   3 4
*   1 2 3 4
*   2 3 5 2
*   0 9 8 -2
* (3 and 4 in the first line represent this is a 3 x 4 matrix)
*
* Output:
* A string represents the transpose of a matrix.
* Each line represents one row and one white space between each two elements.
* Example output string:
* 1 2 0
* 2 3 9
* 3 5 8
* 4 2 -2
